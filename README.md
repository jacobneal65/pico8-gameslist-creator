# pico8-gameslist-creator
a small python script that creates &lt;game> xml entries for emulation station's gameslist for the pico 8 system.

The plan is that it will use a folder of pico8 carts to create a basic xml game structure and 

1) set the &lt;image> to the .png cart.
2) make the &lt;name> the file name.
